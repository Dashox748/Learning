        <p>
          A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body
          reentry capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our
          capsule is where you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes
          a space gym, cinema, and plenty of other activities to keep you
          entertained.
